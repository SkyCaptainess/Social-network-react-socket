classes - important in object oriented programming

components start with a capital letter

in react only class elements can have state



```javascript
async function fn() {
    return 10;
}

fn().then(console.log);
```

await operator can only be used in an async function

```javascript
async function fn() {
    var x = await dbl(10);
    console.log(x);
    return x;
}

fn().then(console.log).catch(() => console.log('caught'));
```

```javascript
async function getTweets() {
	const token = await twitter.getToken().catch(function() {
		return config.savedToken;
	});
	let tweets;
	try {
		const tweets = await twitter.getTweets(token);
	} catch (e) {
		tweets = ['nonsense'];
	}
}
```

```javascript
async function getImageWithComments(id) {
    const image = getImageById(id);
    const comments = getCommentsByImageId(id);
    return { 
        image: await image, 
        comments: await comments 
    };
}
```

happening in the same time

```javascript
exports.getUserId = async id => {
    const {rows} = db.query(`SELECT FROM user`, [id]);
    return rows[0];
}
```

in app create a method **setImage()** -passed  image as an argument(url)

updating the image in state to get the value of new profile picture

we have to pass the set image method from app to uploader

then uploader:    t**his.props.setImage(newPic)**

if bio show bio f not add your bio now, also option to edit bio

store the bio in the state in app

app {first last img bio }

bio editor grandchild 

we can only pass props to children

--> pass bio as a prop to profile component, then profile passes it to biodeitor as a prop

should be able to log this.props.bio and see the bio if userr has a bio





profile pic also grandchild

pass img as a prop to profile and then asa  prop from profile to profile pic



first and last just pass as props to profile



updating the bio



uploader had to pass image to app



in app state define the method to define the bio 

setBio() method will be passed the new bio and when set bio is invoked will set the new bio as a value in the state of app

no matter where we invoke the settBio it will update the value in the app state

we can pass it as a prop to bio editor component -- we pass the new bio to the setBio and it will set the value in app

we have tp pas  setBio to profile and then from profile to bio editor component

type in new bio ----- press the SAVE button

make sure you dn't change the name

when everything worked with putting the bio in with axios, then we call setBio

setBio should toggle text area

if no bio render the add bio button, otherwise edit button

when either of these are clicked, toggle the etxt area

all of this should be defined in the bio  editor



biodeitor a class component so it could have state

store user bio in state

thats how we handle the user input

do we want state to help toggling the text area



toggling the text area imilar to toggling the uploader





this.props.match is a prop of browserrouter

```js
expect(myMockFn.mock.calls[0]).toEqual([10, 0, a]);
```

1. what are we iterating over
2. what is the index
3. the full array we're iterating over







HOOKS

```javascript
class MyCom extends React.Component {
    componentDidMount() {
        window.addEventListener()
    }
    componentWillUnmount() {
        window.removeEventListener()
    }
}
```

main idea of hooks is grouping logic together

1. hooks can only be used in funct components or other hooks - you cant use hooks in class components
2. hooks shouldn't be used in loops or conditionals
3. all hooks must start with the word "use"

```javascript

```

useState gives us just specific state roperties

const [name, setName] = useState('World');

name is declared as a state property and set the default value of World

function Hello() {
    const [name, setName] = useState('World');
    return (

        <div>Hello, {name}!</div>
​    );
}



not this.state.name

setname is a function that inokes the change

it causes the component to re-render

we dont call them inside a function where they are declared - endless re-renders

in react when we want to render an array we do it with a map

array.map( is a loop)

useEffect - lifecycle methods - componentDidMount for instance

always pass useEffect a callback

useEffect will run when component runs and whenever we change state

if we pass empty array as a second argument, it will run only once and never again even if there is state change - thats how you have componentDidMount

when you put a variable inside an empty array, useEffect to run when component mounts and when that variable changes

cleanup function can console log the state before the change

equivalent of componentWillUnmount



useEffect 2 jobs - when mounts and getting the users who match the search term





**step 1** - render the friend button inside the other profile

pass ing the id of the person on whose page we re on as a prop to the button

this.props.match.params.id



**step 2** -get the initial status of the friendship when component mounts - ajax req - render the right button



**step 3** - render the right txt on the button depending on the status of the friendship - just the xt should change, there should be only one button

status: undefined or null => send ffriend req

status: false - friend req has been sent but not accepted - the text should be accept or cancel depending on the sender or receiver of the req

status: true - users have a friendship - both buttons should say end frinedship



**step 4** if the user clicks on make friends button - make a post req to the server

/send-fr/:id

if the button says accept , a separate post request post req to a separate route

/accept-fr/:id

if the user clicks cancel or end friendship, we trigger post req that says end friendship

/end-fr/:id





**step 5** we have to change the text on the button the same moment you click on the button

conditionals - when click in addition to post req you change the txt - you use the same condition for post req

make -> cancel

cancel -> make

accept ->end

end -> make



change the button txt after the res from the server



button txt could be the state property that changes as the friendship changes, value is a string

this.state.txt if hook just txt



sql



CREATE TABLE friendships (

I	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,

​	sender_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),

receiver_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),

accepted BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,

created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

)



if 2 users have no kind of relationship they have no rows in this table 





server 4 routes

```javascript
GET /get-initial-status/:id
```





custom hooks

```javascript
function useStatefulFields() {
    const [fields, setFields] = useState({})
    function handleChange({target}) {
        setFields({
            ...fields,
            [target.name]: target.value
        })
    }
    return [fields, handleChange]
}


// now use it in function Login

const [fields, handleChange] = useStatefulFields()
const [error, submit] = useAuthSubmit('/login --- or /register')

//

function useAuthSubmit(url) {
    const [error, setError] = useState(false);
    function submit() {
        axios.post(url, fields).then(
            ({data}) =>
            	data.success ? location.replace('/') : setError(true)
        );
    }
    return [error, submit];
}
```

the validation that is important has to happen on the server







REDUX

the state object is replaced with  a whole new object



```javascript
const oldSTates = [];
function myReducer(state={}, action) {
    oldStates.push(state);
    if (action.type == 'UPDATE BIO') {
        state = {
            ...state,
            user: {
                ...state.user,
                bio: action.bio
            }
        };
    }
    if (action.type == 'SHOW_BIO_TEXTAREA') {
        state = {
            ...state,
            bioEditorTextAreaIsVisible: true
                
        }
    }
    return state;
}
```

```javascript
var fields = {};

function addAge(obj) {
    obj = 10;
}
```

middleware function happens between create action and reducer

```javascript
function async updateBio(newBio) {
    await axios.post('/bio', {newBio});
    return {
        type: UPDATE_BIO,
        newBio
    }
}
```

```javascript
function Bio(props) {
    const dispatch = useDispatch();
    const bio = useSelector(
        state => state.user && state.user.bio
        
// if state.user is truthy, give me state.user.bio
    );
    return (
        <div className="bio">
            {bio || (
                <a onClick={e => dispatch(
                    showBioEditorTextarea()
                )}>
                    Please add your bio.
                </a>
            )}
        </div>
    );
}

```

redux state -global

local state - state of a component



!! converts a truthy value to true







redux

array of friends & array of requests





redux devtools - changes reflected instantly



jump to previous actions - good for debugging - time travel for every step of the way



when component mounts we will dispatch an action - its gonna be a redux hook

dispatch is going to happen in component itself

-> actions.js

action - a function that returns an object, that object will be passed to reducer and then reducer is gonna do sth with it

action is going to talk to the server for us

the way we use axios remains the same, backend remains the same

the file that makes the req is different - its not coming from component but from action.js

the object that action returns must have a type

type value must be a string - it is a convention: uppercase + underscore



when objct is returned, it's passed to the reducer

reducer always makes a copy of the state and modifies that copy

thats a new object in a new location in memory

redux knows that if the object is in the new location than the state has changed and therefore updates

... - spread operator is good for making copies of arrays and objects

state = {

 ...

}

```javascript
let  arr = [1, 2, 3];
let newArr = [...arr, 5];
//or
let newArr = [5, ...arr];

```

copying the array and adding a new item
