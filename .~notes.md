classes - important in object oriented programming

components start with a capital letter

in react only class elements can have state



```javascript
async function fn() {
    return 10;
}

fn().then(console.log);
```

await operator can only be used in an async function

```javascript
async function fn() {
    var x = await dbl(10);
    console.log(x);
    return x;
}

fn().then(console.log).catch(() => console.log('caught'));
```

```javascript
async function getTweets() {
	const token = await twitter.getToken().catch(function() {
		return config.savedToken;
	});
	let tweets;
	try {
		const tweets = await twitter.getTweets(token);
	} catch (e) {
		tweets = ['nonsense'];
	}
}
```

```javascript
async function getImageWithComments(id) {
    const image = getImageById(id);
    const comments = getCommentsByImageId(id);
    return { 
        image: await image, 
        comments: await comments 
    };
}
```

happening in the same time

```javascript
exports.getUserId = async id => {
    const {rows} = db.query(`SELECT FROM user`, [id]);
    return rows[0];
}
```

in app create a method **setImage()** -passed  image as an argument(url)

updating the image in state to get the value of new profile picture

we have to pass the set image method from app to uploader

then uploader:    t**his.props.setImage(newPic)**

if bio show bio f not add your bio now, also option to edit bio

store the bio in the state in app

app {first last img bio }

bio editor grandchild 

we can only pass props to children

--> pass bio as a prop to profile component, then profile passes it to biodeitor as a prop

should be able to log this.props.bio and see the bio if userr has a bio





profile pic also grandchild

pass img as a prop to profile and then asa  prop from profile to profile pic



first and last just pass as props to profile



updating the bio



uploader had to pass image to app



in app state define the method to define the bio 

setBio() method will be passed the new bio and when set bio is invoked will set the new bio as a value in the state of app

no matter where we invoke the settBio it will update the value in the app state

we can pass it as a prop to bio editor component -- we pass the new bio to the setBio and it will set the value in app

we have tp pas  setBio to profile and then from profile to bio editor component

type in new bio ----- press the SAVE button

make sure you dn't change the name

when everything worked with putting the bio in with axios, then we call setBio

setBio should toggle text area

if no bio render the add bio button, otherwise edit button

when either of these are clicked, toggle the etxt area

all of this should be defined in the bio  editor



biodeitor a class component so it could have state

store user bio in state

thats how we handle the user input

do we want state to help toggling the text area



toggling the text area imilar to toggling the uploader





this.props.match is a prop of browserrouter

```js
expect(myMockFn.mock.calls[0]).toEqual([10, 0, a]);
```

1. what are we iterating over
2. what is the index
3. the full array we're iterating over







HOOKS

```javascript
class MyCom extends React.Component {
    componentDidMount() {
        window.addEventListener()
    }
    componentWillUnmount() {
        window.removeEventListener()
    }
}
```

main idea of hooks is grouping logic together
